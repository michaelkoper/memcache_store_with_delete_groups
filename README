MemCache Store with delete groups
================
Author: Michael Koper.

= Description
If you're using default Memcache store provided by Rails (2.1) you're probably missing functionality like delete_matched() to clear cache with Regex. This plugin is implementing some kind of feature but not with Regex but with groups. A regex solution will be very slow with a lot of requests. Because of speed reasons this plugin does not use delete_matched but delete_type. It's possible to delete groups of cache in 1 call. It's not memcache implementation but simple Ruby code to provide this functionality. This plugin is well tested on a server with more then 600 requests a minute and with 8 memcached servers combined. 

This plugin fixes the known errors like 'undefined class module ClassName' as well.

= Installation with Rails > 2.1
script/plugin install git://github.com/michaelkoper/memcache_store_with_delete_groups.git

= Usage

To fetch groups called pages:

  Rails.cache.fetch([:pages, 1], :delete_type => true) { "page 1" }
  Rails.cache.fetch([:pages, 2], :delete_type => true) { "page 2" }
  Rails.cache.fetch([:pages, 3], :delete_type => true) { "page 3" }
	
To delete all the pages:

  Rails.cache.delete_type(:pages)

= Requirements
  - Memcache
  - memcache-client gem

I stole the idea and some code from this repostiroy: git://github.com/martincik/memcache_store_with_delete_matched.git
